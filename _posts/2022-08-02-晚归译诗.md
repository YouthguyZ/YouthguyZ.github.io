> Stray birds of summer come to my window to sing and fly away.And yellow leaves of autumn,which have no songs,flutter and fall there with a sign. 
<br>
流浪的夏鸟，栖歇我窗，给予我夏歌；飘落的秋叶，叶落知秋，无歌飞入冬。
<br>
> O Troupe of little vagrants of the world,leave your footprints in my words. 
<br>
世界红尘滚滚，我小小的天涯游子们呐，请在我的文字里留下你们的足迹吧。
<br>      
> The world puts off its mask of vastness to its lover. It becomes small as one song, as one kiss of the eternal. 
<br>
世界向爱它的的人摘下虚伪笨重的面具，突然变小，小的似乎一首歌，小的似一个绵长的吻。
<br>
> The sands in your way beg for your song and your movement, dancing water .Will you carry the burden of their lameness. 
<br>     
你浪途上的沙子恳求你的歌声与律动。它们在路途跛足，你也能负担起吗？
